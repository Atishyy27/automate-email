Automating Sending emails, using python script.
In csv files, there are 3 sections, name, email and certifificates, which are self-explainatory.
In certificates folder, insert all the images, whose name should be same in the csv file.

after putting the list of names of all the entries, run the script using 
"python main.py"

the program might be slow depending upon the size of certificates.
